# MyReads
This is an app to track books that you're reading, have finished, or are interested in reading. It's part of the Front-End Nanodegree Program at Udacity.

# Usage
To use this app, download or clone the repository, and run `npm install` inside the directory.
Once all dependencies are installed, you can use `npm start` to start the server.
Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser to see the app! (A new tab should open automatically when the server starts.)
